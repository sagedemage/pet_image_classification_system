    | This is the pet image picker application. The purpose of this application is to make it convenient 
    | for the user to pick a pet image to use with the pet image classification system program. I decided 
    | express.js was the best way to use for the pet image picker since it is fast when it comes to 
    | loading all of the pet images.
